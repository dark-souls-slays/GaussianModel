- Every pixel has 2 probabilities "it is duck" and "it is not duck"
- Given that P(w1) and P(w2) are the same, P(wi|x) = P(x|wi)
- We only need to identify certain white areas as ducks; therefore
  change image to black and white.

Gaussian Distribution

The normal distribution is a form presenting data by arranging the
probability distribution of each value in the data.Most values remain
around the mean value making the arrangement symmetric.

We use various functions in numpy library to mathematically calculate
the values for a normal distribution.
